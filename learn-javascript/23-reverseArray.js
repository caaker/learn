/*

  Notes:

  Algorithm:

    base case of 1 item - the loop will not run and the original array is returned
    iterative case of 2 items ( even ) - there will be one swap
    iterative case of 3 items ( odd ) - use Math.floor to ensure that the middle element is not swapped with itself

  Complexity:

    Time Complexity is O(n) with a constant of 1/2
    Space complexity is O(1) as there is no additional space needed.  The values are swapped in place.
